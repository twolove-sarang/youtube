Kim has a “big life” full of tons of opinions but has somehow mastered remaining calm mentally and emotionally despite it all. She admits she doesn’t look at comments, is open to self-correction, and believes in the room for redemption but reveals that the robbery in Paris is what really shifted her values in a major way. \n\nEveryone is going through something in real life, Kim Kardashian included. In this episode, Kim shares how the memories of her own father help her keep it together for her kids and continue to be what leads her in her very complex co-parenting journey.  \n\nDespite all that’s happening around her, she makes time where there is often none, is dedicated to helping others, and admits to truly feeling at peace. Kim Kardashian is free, having fun, and enjoying dating, even if it means various forms of dating in the house. \n\nThis is an episode you won’t want to miss. \n\nWebsite: https://www.angiemartinez.com \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialangiemartinez (Like)",
